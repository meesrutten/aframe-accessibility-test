# A Frame accessibility test

Users of VR with decreased mobility might be unable to use most user interfaces that require point-and-click interactions.

To fight this problem I thought of a solution:
Selection based interaction

If using the arrow keys to select menu objects in VR, users with decreased mobility won't have to point-and-click.
Users will be able to use the arrow keys to select UI elements.
When an element is selected a user can "click" on the VR device "trigger" button.

This project is a prototype and it describes a pattern. The code can be technically implemented but needs refinement.

### Project
- WebVR
- Built in AFrame
- JavaScript interaction
